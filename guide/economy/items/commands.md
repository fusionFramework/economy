# Item commands

Commands are actions that are performed when consuming an item in the inventory.

Any item can have one or more commands, the item's type (default_command) defines a command that every item of that type is forced
to have, you always have the option of adding extra commands on any item you want.

This default command offers a restriction though, for example, if an item type's default command does not come
from the pet category you won't be able to assign other pet-related commands to related items.
